                        <h3>Our Story</h3>
                        <p>FitGear Pro was founded in 2010 by a group of fitness enthusiasts who were frustrated with the lack of high-quality gym accessories and supplements in the market. We set out to create a brand that would provide premium products to help people achieve their fitness goals.</p>
                        <p>Over the years, we've grown from a small startup to a leading provider of fitness gear and supplements, serving customers worldwide. Our commitment to quality, innovation, and customer satisfaction remains at the core of everything we do.</p>
